# gittool

gittool.py is a python library for automation scripts to gather information from a local git repository. It is much faster than the original git commandline. Because the command line git have to reopen the repository repeatedly each time we spawn a new process. gittool instead will cache a lot in momory and keep the state.

gitgui.py is a gui program base on the gittool
